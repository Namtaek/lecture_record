## Statistical Modeling & Machine Learning

This lecture covers...

- Linear regression for non-iid (Estimating Variance-Covariance Sturcture)
- Data-Preprocessing/Missing Data Handling (MICE)
- Dimension Reduction Techniques (KPCA, P-curves, P-surfaces, NMF, ICA)
- Filtering & Variable Selection (Variable importance measures(Relief), Simulated Annealing, ISIS)
- Data Imbalanced (Sampling Methods, Alternative Cut-off(ROC/AUC), Cost-Sensitive learning)

### 2020-02 Statistics major courses HW

1) Data_analysis_HW2

- Basic of Spatial regression/GLM
- For violated Assumption of LSE, use GLS for Timeseries forecasting by estimating AR(1) Covariance structure. Also using GAM for nonlinear patterns.

2) Data_analysis_HW3

- Missing data modeling. Understand the pattern of missing data and apply MICE(Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation)
- Variable transformation for polynomial terms. New variables by Dimension reduction.
