### Final Project

Topic : Prediction for Seoul House Price

- data : Dacon 4th Competition 'Prediction the actual price of apartments'
- Preprocess 
  - sin-cos encoding for time variables
  - Catboost encoding for lots of Categorical Variables (Not one-hot/label)
- Modeling : Linear Regression/Decision Tree/Adaboost
  - Our lecture covers those models, so I did not use more fancy model(catboost, lgbm, etc)
